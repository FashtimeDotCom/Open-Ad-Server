Open-Ad-Server
==============

A fork of OpenX with the aim of re-writing, refactoring and generally making something useful from the code. This has now been made unneseccary by the release of Rivive Adserver which is makeing a lot more effort than I was and has a much more improved chance of success.

*** THIS IS LEGACY CODE ***

Approach
========

The approach to development of this software has largely been to add more and more. This has been ongoing bloat from close to the start.

This is now over.

OpenX is going on a diet. By which I mean that there is not a Moores Law for software and it does not need to double in size every two years.

OpenX and the future
--------------------

* To remove everything that can be removed
* To reduce the sie of that which must stay
* to decrease complexity
* to increase scalability
* to increase efficiency
* to document what is left

Some very stupid bugs
---------------------

There are some truly stupid bugs and short comings that have become so ingrained into the code they are presented by some as "features". 

This too must change.
